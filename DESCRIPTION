Description: biniLasso and its sparse variant, sparse biniLasso, is novel methods for prognostic analysis of high-dimensional data that enable detection of multiple cut-points per feature. This approach works based on two key features: (1) a cumulative binarization scheme with L1-penalized coefficients operating on context-dependent cut-point candidates, and (2) for sparse biniLasso, additional uniLasso regularization, a recently developed two-stage regularized regression, to enforce sparsity while preserving univariate coefficient patterns.
