\title{Extract optimal cut-points from the fitted glmnet model.}
\usage{
cuts_extractor(glm_fit, cols, x_cuts, lambda_opt = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{glm_fit}{the fitted glmnet object}

\item{cols}{a vector of numeric column names (characters)}

\item{x_cuts}{a list of cut-points corresponding to each entry of cols and in the same order.}

\item{lambda_opt}{the value to be used as Lasso optimal lambda value for coefficients extracted. This can be left unspecified (NULL) if lambda value already has been specified in the glm_fit (regular LAsso fit), or alternatively, the glm_fit can contain model fit for a range of lambda values (mainly for uniLasso fit), but for coefficient extraction, the fit corresponding to this lambda value will be used.}
}
\value{
a list of optimal cut-points corresponding to the columns in cols and in the same order.
}
\description{
Extract optimal cut-points from the fitted glmnet model.
